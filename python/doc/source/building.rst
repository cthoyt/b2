Building PyBertini
*******************

This part is unsatisfactory to me.  I really wish the package would just detect dependencies, and build itself.  However, since there is a C++ library behind it, this is not yet implemented.  For now, you have to configure, compile, and install yourself.

Please see `the b2 wiki entry for compilation <https://github.com/bertiniteam/b2/wiki/Compilation-Guide>`_
